Computer science focuses on the development and testing of software and software systems.
It involves working with mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms,
and computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational principles that
are the basis of all software.

Information technology (IT) focuses on the development,
implementation, support, and management of computers and information systems.
IT involves working both with hardware (CPUs, RAM, hard disks) and software (operating systems,
web browsers, mobile applications). IT professionals make sure that computers, networks,
and systems work well for all users.
